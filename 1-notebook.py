# Data science tools

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# OBJECTIVES
# - popular languages for datascience
# - popular libraries used by datascientist
# - arithmetic expressions
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# Then create an ordered list (i.e. numbered) listing 3 (or more) commonly used languages for data science.

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1.numpy()
# 2.pandas()
# 3.matplotlib()

# # Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# x=12
# y=22
# print(x+y)

# In[9]:


a=15
b=19
print(a*b)


# In[4]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[5]:


#this will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
